        <p>Ahoy there! and welcome to the new ahoythere<u>.co.nz</u><br>
        <br>
        So as usual this site is one place where we can put pics and stuff from old happenings and all the new stuff that we do, just for lolingoutloud and cos its cool. As most of you know there has been a few ahoythere.com's over the years, each just as awesome as the last but this one will be a big change. I have the site set up in a way i can easily add things when people request them so it should stay up to date and as it is the first with its very own domain its even easier to find. <br><br>Have a look around anyway and as always harass me about any changes you want or things added. The newly created forum is the best place for that. Peace Out<br><br>Lemusa.</p></td></tr>

<hr align="center">Basic outline of the site below (pretty much just filling up space)<br><br><b>Home</b> - Pretty obvious...your looking at it<br><br><b>Happenings</b> - Eventually this page will have photos and funny things from past and present happenings (it may be a while though cos it'l be a fair bit of work)<br><br><b>Gallery</b> - Again pretty obvious, photos from the good old times right through to yesterday (well not quite)<br><br><b>Forum</b> - Place to comment, complain and talk about whatever<br><br><b>Updates</b> - This page is almost pointless but check it everynow and then cos it'l point out recent changes so you can be sure you arent missing out on anything</p></td>
