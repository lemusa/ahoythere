<p>This be the gallery of beautiful things. To keep it simple its all divided up into years, if any of the years are updated I'll post it on the home page. I haven't got many photos at the moment so any help there would be goodly. Post in the forum if you have any and we'll sort something<br><br>Current albums...<br>
<b>2008</b> - 1 photo<br><b>2007</b> - 19 photos <br><b>2006</b> - 4 photos (Including Elyse's 18th + Bach pics)<br><b>Old School</b> - 3 photos<br><br>All pics on this site are 700x525px or smaller. If you want a bigger resolution of one or three ask me and I can email them to you. Reason for this is I have to keep the entire website size to a minimum.<br><br>At the moment the gallery is kinda basic so for a description of each photo just hover your cursor over it and something should pop up, I will make this better but its effort.</p>
