        <p>Here are the latest updates so you noobs dont have to waste your time looking for
        changes...
        <h4>14-09-08</h4>
        Updated Happenings for Penguin
        <h4>17-07-08</h4>
        Changed the look of the site quite a bit, if you dont like it have a moan in the forum and it can be changed back. Was really just goin for more of a pirate theme...afterall ahoythere.com does have that piratey ring to it. Also the gallery has been shifted around a bit, it might be an issue on smaller res monitors so once again if it all turns to shit just post in the forums
        <h4>12-07-08</h4>
        Woohoo the sites up!
        <h4>09-07-08</h4>
        Added the forum, thanks to nabble.com who just made it so easy, in fact the only reason its there is cos it was that easy
        <h4>19-05-08</h4>
        Added the gallery, stil lots of tweaking to do but its there for now. Let me know if you have ideas for improvements. Its kinda frustrating cos im not so flash with the html and java stuffs so gotta keep things simple.
        <h4>02-05-08</h4>
        Did everything, well thats a lie cos i did it a while ago but have been slack. So
        everything you can see over the 4 pages is new, go look at it.</p>
