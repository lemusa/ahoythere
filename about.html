    <p>As many of you know I have been making websites to do with me and the bunch of chums I call,
    well chums, for quite a while now. I wouldnt know the original release date of ahoythere.com,
    which with much time and little effort was crafted using the (fabulous or rubbish?)
    capabilities of Microsoft Publisher. For its time it was a wonderful thing, and for those who
    can remember it, it was full of giggles and good times. Over time several other ahoythere's
    came and went. It wasn't until maybe the third ahoythere that I started coding the html myself
    and thats when things started to get grooving. Although the sites were pretty much pointless
    they were still worth the internet space they used.<br>
    <br>
    There was quite a big gap between the last ahoythere.com and the switch to ahoythere.co.nz,
    largely due to my slackness. I think you'l all agree though that this is by far the best
    ahoythere there has ever been and I can assure you that this one is here to stay (alot of that
    sureness comes from the fact I paid for the domain lol)<br>
    <br>
    One thing that really pisses me off is that I don't have a copy of any of the previous
    ahoythere's to upload for your viewing pleasure, so i have no choice but to focus on making
    this site the best I possibly can.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway keep coming back, I have almost unlimited webspace and everyone knows I have too much
    time so the only thing stopping this site from becoming bigger and better than you can possibly
    imagine is lack of stuff to put on it. And so we get to the main point of this page...<br>
    <br>
    If there is anything you want to see on this site as far as images and text stuffs fill in the
    form below...</p>

    <form method="post" action="webform.php" name="Comments" id="Comments">
      <table align="left">
        <tr>
          <td><font color="#FF9900">* Name:</font></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><input size="28" name="Name"></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
