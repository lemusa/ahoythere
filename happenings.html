    <p>I finally got around to putting something on this page as you can see. The idea behind this
    page is to just post a few latest pics of stuff that's happened and all have a good LOL at it.
    If anyone has something to say I'll happily post it on here so send anything you want
    through.<br>
    <br>
    You'll notice below the "ahoythere.co.nz Hall Of Fame" which may or may not last depending on
    whether you slack fools get me some stuff to put on it.</p>
