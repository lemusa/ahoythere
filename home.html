    <p>Ahoy there! and welcome to the new ahoythere<u>.co.nz</u><br>
    <br>
    So as usual this site is one place where we can put pics and stuff from old happenings and all
    the new stuff that we do, just for lolingoutloud and cos its cool. This time I have the site
    set up in a way i can easily add things when people request them so it should stay up to date
    and as it is the first with its very own domain its even easier to find.<br>
    <br>
    Have a look around anyway and as always harass me about any changes you want or things added.
    The newly created forum is the best place for that. Peace Out<br>
    <br>
    Lemusa.</p>

    Basic outline of the site below (pretty much just filling up space)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Home</strong> - Pretty obvious...your looking at it<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Happenings</strong> - Eventually this page will have photos and funny things from past
    and present happenings (it may be a while though cos it'l be a fair bit of work)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Gallery</strong> - Again pretty obvious, photos from the good old times right through
    to yesterday (well not quite)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Forum</strong> - Place to comment, complain and talk about whatever<br>
    <br>
    <strong>About/Contact</strong> - A bit of history about the site plus contact details to get a
    hold of me
